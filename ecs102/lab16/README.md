## Manipulation of arrays that store values from external sources
- Counter.java tallies up the frequency of numbers present in source files.
- numArray.ava creates an array containing multiple values from a source file and sums the numbers.
- ReadAndCount.java reads and stores data from a source file and then prints them while numbers exist.
- firstarray.java generates an array with specific parameters and prints part of the array.
