## Introduction to extending classes
- Bowl.java extends Dish class to inherit Dish parameters and define Bowl objects.
- Child.java extends Person class to inherit Person parameters and create Child objects.
- Dish.java contains parameters defining a global dish.
- DishTester.java does exactly what you think it does.
- Driver.java is an overarching class to test Dish and Person parameter manipulation to see if inheritance is working.
- Person.java contains parameters defining a global person.
