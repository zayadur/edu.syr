## Solving complex arithmetic and organizational problems.

- BankAccount.java generates new account numbers
    - Generates 3 random two digit numbers between 10 and 99 inclusive. The program takes the sum of these numbers, divides them by 26, and stores the remainder. The remainder is used to select a letter from the alphabet (0 being A). Finally, the 3 numbers are concatenated along with the stored letter to generate the account number.
- Library.java takes and stores several inputs via the command line and then prints a summary of the inputs in a readable form.
- WordDisplay.java introduces GUI concepts along with previously explored material. The user is asked to enter a word, and then a letter in the word. For the output, three panels are presented horizontally where the stored letter is replaced by an asterisk in the left panel, and a dash in the right panel. The middle panel just displays the original word.
