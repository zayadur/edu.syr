## Introduction to constructors

<u>RecordManager.java</u>
 - Uses the HealthRecord all data constructor to construct an object with hardcoded data. This class invokes every method and demonstrates that in the output.
 - Prompts for a person's information, instantiates an object of the HealthRecord class using the constructor that doesn't pass the height and weight, prints the information from the object, including the person's first name, last name, and date of birth, then caluculates and prints the person's age (in years), maximum heart rate, and target-heart-rate.
 - Asks for the person's height and weight, saves that to the HealthRecord class, and reports the Body Mass Index (BMI).

<u>Earthquake.java</u>
- Prompts for and stores a Richter scale number and prints out a characterization based on the value.
