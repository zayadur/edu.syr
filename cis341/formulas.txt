relative performance

performanceA / performanceB == executionTimeB / executionTimeA

    example:    computerA runs program in 10 seconds
                computerB runs program in 15 seconds
                how much faster is A than B?

                    15/10 = 1.5
                    
                    A is 1.5 times as fast than B


clock cycles and clock cycle times

    CPU execution time = CPU clock cycles * clock cycle time
    CPU execution time = CPU clock cycles / clock rate

    improving performance:  program runs in 10 seconds on computerA
                            computerA has 2GHz clock
                            want computerB to run program in 6 seconds

                            computerB requires 1.2 times as many clock cycles
                            what clock rate should designer target?

                                CPU timeA = CPU clock cycles A / clock rate A
                                10 seconds = CPU clock cycles A / 2.9 * 10^9 cycles/seconds
                                CPU clock cycles A = 10s * 2 * 10^9 cycles/sec = 20 * 10^9 cycles


                                CPU time B = 1.2 * CPU clock cycles A / clock rate B
                                6 seconds = 1.2 * 20 * 10^9 cycles / clock rate B
                                clock rate B = 1.2 * 20 * 10^9 cycles / 6 seconds = 4 * 10^9 cycles/sec = 4 GHz

                                computer B must have twice the clock rate of A


instruction performance

    CPU clock cycles = instructions * average clock cycles per instruction (CPI)

    example:    computerA clock cycle time 250ps and CPI 2.0
                computerB clock cycle time 500ps and CPI 1.2
                which computer is faster and by how much?

                CPU clock cycles A = I * 2.0 (I = number of instructions)
                CPU clock cycles B = I * 1.2

                CPU time A = CPU clock cycles A * clock cycle time = I * 2.0 * 250 = 500 * I ps
                CPU time B = I * 1.2 * 500 = 600 * I ps

                    computer A is faster
                
                by how much?
                
                CPU performance A / CPU performance B = execution time B / execution time A = 600 * I ps / 500 * I ps = 1.2

                    computer A is 1.2 times as fast as computer B


CPU performance equation

    CPU time = instruction count * CPI * clock cycle time
    CPU time = instruction count * CPI / clock rate


    example
                        A   B   C
    CPI                 1   2   3

    Code Sequence
    1                   2   1   2
    2                   4   1   1

    Which code sequence executes the most instructions?
    Which will be faster?
    What is the CPI for each sequence?

        Sequence 1 = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 instructions
        Sequence 2 = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 instructions

        Sequence 2 executes the most instructions


        CPU clock cycles1 = (2*1) + (1*2) + (2*3) = 10
        CPU clock cycles2 = (4*1) + (1*2) + (1*3) = 9

        Sequence 2 is faster

        CPI = CPU clock cycles / instructions
        CPI1 = 10 / 5 = 2.0
        CPI2 = 9 / 6 = 1.5


Amdahl's Law

    Execution time after improvement

    = (execution time affected by improvement / amount of improvement) + execution time unaffected


MIPS

    MIPS = instruction count / (execution time * 10^6)

    MIPS = instruction count / (((instruction count * CPI) / clock rate)) * 10^6) = clock rate / CPI * 10^6
