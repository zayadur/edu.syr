!!! REPORT !!!

The last 3 print statements directly printed the memory addresses of each of the 
    arrays generated by the copy methods.
The memory addresses for x and z were the same, indicating the 'copy2' method 
    directly called for the array, as opposed to 'copy1' which created a new
    array (hence the new memory address), with the same values
