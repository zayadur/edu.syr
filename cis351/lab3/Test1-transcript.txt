!!! REPORT !!!

Two objects 'x' and 'y' are created to set values to the variables 'a' and 'b' in the Box1 class
The first object 'x' is used to set values to both variables 'a' and 'b', and the values are printed
Then the second object 'y' was used to set different values to 'a' and 'b', and the values were printed using the object 'x'
It can be observed that the value for 'a' remains the same in both scenarios, but the value for 'b' is changed

This indicates that, since an instance of 'b' was created within this method and a value was applied to it, 
    and it did not changed when a new value was assigned to it, then 'b' is a static variable. However, 
    since 'a's value changed with a second assignment, this indicates it was an instance variable of the Box1 class.
